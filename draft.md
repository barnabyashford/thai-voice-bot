## Introduction

Since the advent of Large Language Models (LLM), many efforts have been made to either improve LLM's performance at language generation and comprehension, or devise techniques to optimise resource usage of LLM. As LLM evolves over the years, there have also been efforts to extend the linguistic capability beyond the boundary of text. This project aims to do exactly that, although not directly. With the purpose to let LLM be implemented in a chatbot application that is not based on textual conversation, but rather a voice conversation, a "Voice bot".

## Problem Definition 

LLMs are trained on textual data hence their proficiency in generating and understanding natural language in text form.
